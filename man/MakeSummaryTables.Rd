\usage{
MakeSummaryTables(inFile, output_dir, workpath_root)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_dir}{Path to the Excel file to be written (cleaned manifest).}

\item{workpath_root}{Directory where summary PNGs and the combined PDF
will be written.}

\item{manifest_file}{A data frame containing the initial sound manifest created by \code{CreateManifest()}, including
at least the columns \code{fileLength.min}, \code{startTime.hhmm},
\code{group}, \code{plot}, \code{date.mmdd}, \code{area}, and \code{year}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with components:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{df1} Filtered dataset after removing long recordings.
    \item \code{df2} Dataset filtered by deviation from mean duration.
    \item \code{df3} Dataset filtered by start‑time frequency.
    \item \code{summary_table} Wide summary table of counts by
          group/plot/date.
  }
}
\description{
This function performs a multi‑stage cleaning, filtering,
and summarization of sound manifest data. It removes anomalous recordings,
filters based on duration and start‑time frequency, writes the cleaned
manifest to an Excel file, and generates summary tables and visual
summaries for each recording group.
}
\details{
The processing steps are:
\enumerate{
  \item Remove rows where \code{fileLength.min > 70}.
  \item Remove rows whose \code{fileLength.min} deviates by more than
        5\% from the mean duration.
  \item Remove rows whose \code{startTime.hhmm} occurs in fewer than 5\%
        of the rows in the reference dataset.
  \item Write the cleaned manifest (\code{df3}) to an Excel file.
  \item Create a wide summary table of counts per group/plot/date.
  \item Generate PNG summary tables for each group and combine them
        into a single PDF.
}

Progress bars and step messages are printed using the \pkg{cli} package.
